Introduction To Lewis
=====================

This is an introduction to myself,
in hopes to set expectations
and manage any initial questions and concerns.
This is not meant to replace any conversations,
but instead to provide a point of reference
and a starting point for our relationship_.
While writing such a lengthy document
exclusively about myself is a little awkward,
for the sake of my audience,
I feel that I must trudge on.


My Core Values
--------------

Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm big on communication.
I think it is important that we be in communication
with one another,
as a team,
and to the teams we support.
I think `explicit is better than implicit`_.
Communication done right
has the power
to unite people
and alleviate differences.
Communication is the bridge that connects information with excellence.
It is through strong communication
that we turn facts and figures
into stories, strategies, and shared visions.
Communication is what brings us together.

Relationship
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm a people person.
I want to get to know you.
I never want you to feel pressured
to share more than you are comfortable with,
but also know that I am here to listen.
I believe that we are able to make it through the hard times
because of the time we spend together building a relationship
before those times ever come.
Relationship is also the means by which I, as a leader,
get to know you
and learn how to adapt my leadership style
to best suite your own style and needs.

Collaboration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I never want our relationship_ to be one way.
I value the input of everyone on my team
and encourage healthy dialog and discussion.
It's OK to disagree;
I recognize that many of us are passionate about doing the best that we can.
Just keep the disagreement focused on the problem at hand
and don't make it personal.
My mantra is that it’s OK to disagree,
but afterwards,
we need to be comfortable enough to go get a
non-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverage
(I don't want to leave anyone out of getting a beverage).


Team Philosophies
-----------------

Having spent as much time as a team member as I have,
I tend to have opinions on what team success looks like
and how we should work together.

Fail Fast
~~~~~~~~~

I encourage everyone to try things on their own,
but I also ask that you fail fast.
Both myself and your teammates might have more experience
or a different idea
and I would rather us all work together
than have you spin your wheels for an extended time.

Strike a Balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'm always open to trying new libraries,
new technologies,
new methodologies,
but part of our job is to strike a balance
between improving through new
and adding additional cost
in terms of upkeep,
additional maintenance,
and/or knowledge diversity.
Before you go too far down the road on trying something new,
let's have a discussion.
Who knows; maybe you found the Next Big Thing (TM).

Constant Growth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a team member,
I encourage you to constantly grow.
I find value in setting goals throughout the year
that not only move our product or team forward
but also yourself.
Avail yourself to whatever education and training resources
we have at our disposal.

Architecture / Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When I was a developer, I was an opinionated developer.
I have now morphed into an opinionated leader as well.
I have worked on a number of projects
and helped to shape and design them
and so I will most likely do the same with our projects.

In addition,
if you need help, please don't hesitate to ask.
If it is something I have experience with, I'll glad to assist.
If it's not, I probably either know someone who may
or can point you in the right direction.
I never want you to feel like I am meddling or micromanaging,
but I do hope you find me a collaborative partner.


My Commitments to You
---------------------

Open and Honest
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I personally believe that each one of `my core values`_
hinge on us having an open and honest relationship.
I will be open with you about your successes
and areas of improvement.
I will be honest about what we face together,
even if that means that
the times before us are going to be hard or challenging
(sometimes through no fault of our own).
I do not find value in hoarding information
and so try to strike a fair balance between
providing needed information
and keeping private what should be private.

Building Your Brand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Personal brands should be important to everyone.
It is the secret sauce that can make you stand out in a community.
If you don’t develop your own personal brand,
others will do it for you.
Developing your personal brand
is the proactive way of controlling your career development
and how you are perceived in your community.
I want to work with you to help build that brand
and let **you** define who you are to yourself and to your peers.

Shielding You
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Team members are most effective when they are focused on their jobs.
I will work with you
to ensure that you are getting the time and resources you need
to get done what you need to get done
and will play the role of mediator with those wanting your time
or the roll of "bad guy" when necessary.
That is not to say that you get to operate without accountability
or consequences.
Rather, I want to provide an appropriate level of cover
to let you get done what needs to get done
while letting you get involved when needed as well.

Letting You Grow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to helping you in `building your brand`_,
I want give you the freedom to grow.
If you want the opportunity to try something new
or outside the normal routine of your job,
I want to help you find those opportunities.
If you want to take on additional responsibilities within our work,
I encourage that as well.
I want all of us to be growing and maturing
and I want to ensure you have those opportunities.

All Ears
~~~~~~~~

While it is in my nature to try to solve any problem presented to me [#]_,
I recognize that sometimes everyone just needs someone
to listen to concerns or frustrations without judgment.
I want to always be an available outlet to listen
and accept your frustration without judgment.
If there are actions we need to take together to improve a situation,
I'm here to help (`Shielding You`_),
but if you just need someone to hear you out,
I'm here for that as well.


Nitty-Gritty
------------

1:1s
~~~~

One-on-ones can be one of the most valuable meetings that we can have.
To that end, I place them at the highest of importance.
They are one of the last meetings I will ever cancel,
and even if I need to move them,
I will make sure that works for you first.
For me, the one-on-one is a time to get to know one another
and for you to talk about what you want.
Do not feel obligated to give me a status update;
there are other times and mechanisms for that.
We can talk about your career, your life, your frustrations.
Topics of conversation during a one-on-one have ranged from
discussing college football (Sic 'em Bears)
to capital gains taxes,
to great vacation spots.
Our one-on-ones will be scheduled regularly
and will always be scheduled for 30 minutes,
but I do try to set aside the following 30 minutes in case we go long.

Work Hours and Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the most part, I'm pretty flexible with when and where you want to work,
within the bounds of what is acceptable within the company.
I tend to be an arrive-early, leave-early type of person
and know not everyone has that preference.
I do ask that we come to agreement where your availability
overlaps a majority of the team and any other teams with whom we interact.

Communication Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I love utilizing all our available communication mediums
but also recognize each also has its own area of strength:

    * Video and face-to-face are great for high bandwidth conversations.
      If it's a discussion where a decision is made,
      make sure that decision is recorded somewhere for posterity.
    * Slack for quick communication.
      It's hard to beat the speed at which
      an asynchronous conversation can transpire on Slack.
    * Jira for accountability.
      When a decision is made,
      or needs to be made,
      put it into a Jira
      so that we have a history of the discussion and decision.
      Jiras are not reserved for tracking items related to development.
      When in doubt, Jira it out.

My Calendar is Yours... Sort Of
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I get sucked into a lot of meetings of various importance.
If you need to talk about something,
feel free to schedule something on my calendar;
any available slots are for the taking.
If you cannot find an available slot
in the time window you need,
feel free to reach out;
I can usually find someone to cover for a meeting
or reschedule another meeting
so that we can chat.

Work / Life Balance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I believe strongly in a work-life balance,
and tend to err on the side of life.
As a parent of two special needs children,
I know that things come up unexpectedly
and so if you need to take care of something,
make sure I'm in the loop, but don't fret over it.
I encourage everyone to use their PTO;
it is a benefit the company provides
and you're just giving the company money back if you don't use it.

Feedback / Performance Review
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let me tell you my frequency with providing impromptu feedback with a story:

    A couple was watching a romantic comedy
    and the wife turns to the husband and says,
    "Why don't you ever tell me I love you like they do in the movie?",
    to which the husband responds,
    "I told you I love you when we got married.
    If that ever changes, I'll let you know".

I know that people appreciate timely and meaningful feedback
and this is an area of growth for me.
However, I never want any required formal reviews
to be the first time you receive feedback on a particular issue,
positive or negative;
if that happens, it is a failure on my part as a manager,
not on you as a team member.
To combat this outcome,
as well as to provide a structured mechanism for me
to provide meaningful feedback,
I do ask everyone to participate in scheduled performance check-ins
throughout the year.
These can be as frequent as you would like,
but I request a minimum frequency of once per quarter.
These are discussion that are only between the two of us;
nothing is recorded in any system for others to read.
This is a time to discuss what has transpired,
the trajectory you are on,
and what success looks like.


About Me
--------

If you've made it this far, congratulations.
Now that you know some about my leadership style,
let me tell you a bit more about myself.

Past Experience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before moving into management,
I worked as a software developer for 12 years,
working almost exclusively with Python [#]_.
In that time I did web development,
industrial automation,
distributed computing,
and quality engineering.
I've attended three PyCon conferences
and had the privilege to speak at one [#]_.
I have a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology
and Masters of Divinity in Theology,
so going into programming was a logical progression.

Strengths
~~~~~~~~~

I enjoy the Gallup StrengthsFinder_
and find it a great way to understand our unique talents
and how we differ and how we can leverage our diversity of strengths
to make a better team.
To that end, I share with you my Top 10 Strengths:

    1. Woo
    2. Communication
    3. Ideation
    4. Relator
    5. Strategic
    6. Belief
    7. Responsibility
    8. Adaptability
    9. Activator
    10. Arranger

For me, I tend to see my strengths in distinct groupings
that work together to shape who I am,
for good or ill.

My combination of **Ideation** + **Strategic** + **Activator** + **Arranger**
results in a lot dreaming, planning,
and throwing things against the wall
and seeing if it sticks.
I rarely see the minutia
but certainly can see the big picture
and where we should go.
I'm rarely short on plans and dreams and ideas
on things we could try
to make our team or product better.
However, the flip side to these strengths is that
I dream but don't do.
I end up with a lot of ideas
that either never get started or never get finished.

In the past,
my team often complained that I would throw out a bunch of ideas
and struggled to know what was dreaming
and what were items that needed action.
While I think I have gotten better about recognizing this tendency
and calling out what should be done
and what was just ideas,
I also encourage you to ask clarifying questions
if clarity is still lacking.

My **Woo** + **Communication** + **Relator** + **Adaptability**
combines to make me the outgoing, gregarious, talkative person that I am.
I will gladly bend your ear
and I want to find the middle ground that keeps everyone happy.
This combination has helped me to build key relationships
and influence decisions from across the team to across the company.
However, this combination can be quite overwhelming to introverts
and those just less inclined to verbal communication.
It can also cause me to be a bit overly diplomatic
to the point of seeming indecisive.

My **Belief** and **Responsiblity** make me passionate about what I do
and fully committed to the cause at hand
and am passionate about doing the right thing
(even if I don't see the details through).
That passion and responsibility extends to my team
and what I am willing to do to help everyone succeed.
The downside is that I can become obsessive
about doing what I believe is right,
struggle to say "no",
and overextend myself.

Situational Leadership
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I believe in situational leadership,
and have utilized the `Situational Leadership Theory`_
to help contextualize the concept.
The theory identifies four primary leadership styles,
and encourages using all four as needed.
However, in my experience,
I tend to default to the "Supporting" style,
which means I tend to be highly supportive but not very directive.
I am more likely to engage in discussion about what needs to be done,
but encourage you to decide.
I do try to be aware of the situation,
but if you find that my leadership style
doesn't provide you the support or direction you need,
please let me know
so that we can get correctly aligned
instead of you feeling frustrated.

Areas of Improvement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I know this is a shocker,
but I am not a perfect human, employee, or leader.
I'll give you a minute to recover from this revelation.

In the vein of being `open and honest`_,
I want to share with you some areas of improvement feedback
that I have received
and to let you know that these are areas that may impact you as well:

* "I have noticed that Lewis can get bogged down
  when he's working on tasks that are not necessarily engaging."
* "He does struggle a bit when transitioning roles or large tasks"
* "Sometimes it can be hard to get a word in edgewise with Lewis in a meeting"
* "Lewis occasionally will seem disconnected in meetings"
* "His need to protect his team
  can sometimes make him overly sensitive to perceived slights."
* "He needs to understand when the situation calls for a more serious tone
  and resist the urge to always crack jokes."

I recognize each of these areas of improvement
and am continually working to grow and mature.
I know that each of you have areas of improvement as well
and believe, that together, we can work on our areas of improvement
to become better people and employees.

Favorite Phrases
----------------

Below is a collection of phrases
that I tend to use over-and-over.
To save us all time,
I have tried to explain my meaning for each below.

E > I
  Since I value communication_,
  I like to check sometimes
  that I didn't miss anything.
  I tend to use `E > I`
  to denote I'm making sure I heard right
  rather than needing additional details.

Know Your Why
  As a team and organization grows,
  there becomes an increasing need to add process.
  However, I hate when process exists for process sake
  so I like to make sure we know the why of the process
  and not just the how.
  The how gets the job done
  but the why can keep us motivated to do it
  or give us context to make needed changes
  when necessary.

What got us here won't get us there
  While the phrase is borrowed (stolen) from a book_,
  it's about recognizing that the decisions that we made in the past
  are not the decisions we need to make today.
  We do not need to be apologetic about those past decisions;
  they were made with what was known at the time.
  Instead, be open to the ever-changing environment
  that is our job and be ready for change.

RR
  Granted, RR isn't really a phrase
  as much as it is an initialization.
  But there is an entire ethos behind those letters:
  We reserve the right to get smarter.
  We don't have to have the perfect solution today,
  we can find good enough now
  and think of a better way to do things in the future,
  especially as we learn and mature.
